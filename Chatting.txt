3:27 PM
Yeah.
3:28 PM
M
I was offered Selenium, but I think this is too cumbersome.

I need that information in real time, to use it in python.
3:31 PM
How long should it take?
3:33 PM
M
How long can you do it?
3:33 PM
1~3 day
3:36 PM
What about you?
3:36 PM
M
I just need a script that prints the data to the console.
3:36 PM
What is the deadline? I would like to hear your opinion, first.
3:38 PM
M
Maximum 2 days. I can pay what you ask for 120 dollars.
3:39 PM
Okay, no problem.
3:39 PM
Could you create the milestone?
3:40 PM
M
ok
3:40 PM
On GitHub, there is a project called tvdatafeed that basically simulates a user's access to TradingView to download data automatically.
3:46 PM
Hi, are u there?
3:46 PM
M
yes I just want to be sure you can do it.
3:47 PM
So do you wanna test me?
3:48 PM
M
I just need to know, how do you think you can do it. I only have 2 days and I don't want to waste them.
3:49 PM
Plz trust me. I am good at Python.
3:51 PM
After only one hour, I will submit my proposal for your project.
3:51 PM
What do you think?
3:54 PM
Do you agree or Not? Plz tell me about your opinion.
3:59 PM
M
I'm talking to someone else who has an older profile and comments, I still can't decide. I don't have any references from you in your profile. That's why I need you to tell me something so that I understand that I can do the job
4:02 PM
Okay, so what should I do?
4:05 PM
I will follow you.
4:05 PM
M
Tell me what method you will use to get the data. Not Selenium.
4:06 PM
Okay, I will use Playwright
4:07 PM
If your requests are getting blocked, it could be due to
Missing headers and Bot detection.
4:10 PM
M
Doesn't this consume a lot of resources?
4:10 PM
A bit..
4:11 PM
M
After getting this data, I will run it in a python bot
4:11 PM
So what do you want?
4:11 PM
M
I thought the data could be intersected, in real time, but perhaps I am too optimistic.
4:12 PM
Anyway, I think you are the right person.
4:13 PM
Maybe you have several options for me.
